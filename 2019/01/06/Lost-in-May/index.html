<h3 id="Chapter-1"><a href="#Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1"></a>Chapter 1</h3><p>May was also her name. </p>
<p>However cliché this seems, I am not trying to make it a pun. After all, we never even talked in May. We met in our freshman year in a group project and that was it. No sparks. Not even Oxygen. So imagine how I felt when, one day in the summer vacation before my senior year, she just commented one of the articles I shared on social media out of the blue. It’s like a book on the shelf just randomly drops on your feet, and then you pick it up with the faintest idea of how you got it in the first place.</p>
<p>All the memory left after 3 years was she looked pretty(maybe) and quiet as the morning breeze in May. Like the name suggests. So I, a little bit flattered, tried to be cool and replied with some sweet remarks from the article. </p>
<p>Then she replied back.</p>
<p>The next thing I knew was, we began chatting in the comment zone at midnight, with a kind of unknown chemistry. The following days would witness us chatting over the phone every night before going to bed. And one day she would be laying in my arms, with tears in her eyes. She asked me one day how I felt when I started “hitting on her”, I told her this little tale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, you were doing nothing as always, living your day to day mundane life. Nothing worth mentioning happens in your life. Then all of a sudden you saw a rope. At first sight it looked like a snake and you were afraid of snakes. So you stood aghast, speechless. When you find it was only a rope, you began to wonder the other end of it. What could it be? You pulled, and 3 Mississippi’s later, something pulled on the other end. It could be a naughty dog, but deep down inside your heart, you wished it was a signal, a language or most important of it all, a cure to the meaningless life you were living. So you pulled again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s how I felt. I wasn’t sure if May understood it. I wasn’t sure if I understood it. I wasn’t telling a parable; I was just describing a state of mind. It was a very personal thing anyway. I think she bought it at that time because she stopped asking any more questions. Or maybe it was only because it was at midnight.</p>
<p>So back to the first midnight we began chatting. I had some drinks that night. I was doing an internship at a tech company. The work load was fine but I wasn’t enjoying it as I thought it would make me. It was my dream company and when I actually got in and get my dream job, I began wondering if all this dreams are misguided illusions. Maybe I made myself love the job just because my subconscious thought it would maximize my chances of survival and getting laid. So I was constantly in the state of being both awake and lost. Being aware of lost is worse than lost completely, which explains the drinks I had.</p>
<p>It could be the alcohol, for I felt joy when I was chatting with her. My creativity was flowing and I replied clever and flirty remarks like Romeo of every girl’s dreams. Or at least that’s what I felt at the moment. I sensed something different about this girl, May. She was able to keep up with the flow. We talked like two people walking out of a compilation of clever remarks by Plátōn, Bernard Shaw and Woody Allen. The chemistry was amazing and there were not just sparks but an explosion of flirting, sarcastic and witty messages.</p>
<p>I decided to make the first move. Pounding was my heart, and gentle was my touch on her chat box like treading on thin ice. I sent the message that literally changed our lives, with an adorable meme,<br>“How you doing”</p>
