<h2 id="01"><a href="#01" class="headerlink" title="01"></a>01</h2><p>My friend of benefit (<em>intellectually of course</em>, :) Kaitlyn de Maine recommended <a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is water</a> speech by David Foster Wallace to me，claiming that I would love it. And SURE I DO. ^0^ So I thought it would be sweet if I write something about it. Since my personal blog just set up, this would make a strong start.</p>
<h2 id="02"><a href="#02" class="headerlink" title="02"></a>02</h2><p>At the beginning of the speech, there is a parable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”                                </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So, what is water?</strong></p>
<p>Take a moment to think about what is special about water: It is transparent, it is everywhere and it had been here long before any of the fishes were born, which makes the fishes totally <em>unaware</em> of it. Now you see, the parable, as well as the speech, is about <strong>awareness</strong>.</p>
<p>Mainly, awareness about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness about yourself and your certainties</li>
<li>Awareness about what to worship</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-1-Awareness-about-yourself-and-your-certainties"><a href="#2-1-Awareness-about-yourself-and-your-certainties" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Awareness about yourself and your certainties"></a>2.1 Awareness about yourself and your certainties</h3><p>Just like what he said in the speech：The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Too often we ignore the most plain and common things around us. We get used to lots of things, taking them for granted and accept claims without a second thought. There are so many things that we are just automatically sure of, as if they were hard-wired into our boards at birth. David ( who addressed the speech) gave one example of the total wrongness of something he tends to be automatically sure of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds arrogant, conceited and pretencious but very ture and sincere. I guess deep down inside our heart, more or less we’ve all been through this stage. At least I did and I doubt if I have ever been ‘through’ it. This reminds me of my WeChat alias(user name). </p>
<p>*FYI WeChat is an app We Chinese use, in some ways it’s like Snapchat + Instagram + Facebook + Paypal.</p>
<p>The alias consists of a Chinese charater of my last name and these letters–”NPC”. <strong>NPC</strong>, meaning Non-Player Charater, is an idea from video games, mainly Role-Playing games. I, too, used to think that I am the absolute centre of the universe. I have always been the sentimental type and one day I just wake up with the idea that I am no centre of the universe and then I just went from one extreme to another: That life is a game and I am only a NPC, having no control over my own life, and the highlight of my entire life is being a background for the big names like Jack Ma, Steve Jobs, Kim Chŏng-ŭn… you name it. Luckily that kind of feeling didn’t last very long and I kept the name ever since because I also find it important to constantly remind myself that <strong>I am no centre of the universe</strong> and sometimes might as well view myself as a NPC and then, all the winning and losing, sorrows and pains doesn’t matte that much.</p>
<p>And here I would quote Sir Romain Rolland:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Il n’ya qu’un héroïsme au monde : c’est de voir le monde tel qu’il est et de l’aimer.</em><br>There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is and to love it.<br>    by Romain Rolland</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-2-Awareness-about-what-to-worship"><a href="#2-2-Awareness-about-what-to-worship" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Awareness about what to worship"></a>2.2 Awareness about what to worship</h3><p>David said in the speech:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you <strong>worship</strong> money and things, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough.<br><strong>Worship</strong> your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly.<br><strong>Worship</strong> power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. <strong>Worship</strong> your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.<br>But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everybody seems worship one of the above. The horrible thing is most of the time it is our defalut setting, it is blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up. SO you have to be aware of what you worship before your pursuit consumes you. Never be the a slave to your head and your natural default settings.</p>
<h2 id="03-Coda–the-real-freedom"><a href="#03-Coda–the-real-freedom" class="headerlink" title="03 Coda–the real freedom"></a>03 Coda–the real freedom</h2><p>At the end of the day, after fighting against our arrogant selves, our blind certainties and our pride and prejudice we got to know the <strong>real freedom</strong>.</p>
<p>“The kind of freedom that involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.”</p>
<p>The day you begin to see the water as it is, is when you are truly free and alive.</p>
