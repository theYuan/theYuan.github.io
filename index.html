<p>“One day in the future, quantum databases are one of our key technologies for transforming other planets.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On January 17, at the Alibaba Cloud 2018 Cloud Database Smart Future Conference held in Beijing, Alibaba’s senior product expert Wang Yicheng said.</p>
<h3 id="Since-it-is-a-conference-about-the-future-let’s-talk-about-the-future"><a href="#Since-it-is-a-conference-about-the-future-let’s-talk-about-the-future" class="headerlink" title="Since it is a conference about the future, let’s talk about the future."></a>Since it is a conference about the future, let’s talk about the future.</h3><p>“The fate of the future human beings is closely related to the database.” At the Aliyun Cloud Database Intelligent Future Conference, Wang Yicheng, head of Alibaba Cloud NoSQL products, said.</p>
<p>This seemingly unrelated issue was folded together at the Aliyun Cloud Database Future Conference.</p>
<p>Humans are experiencing the era of data explosions, and the data generated in 2017 is more than the data generated in the entire history of mankind.</p>
<p>In the eyes of engineers, the current data is far from enough.</p>
<p>By 2035, the number of humans will reach 9.5 billion, and today’s crop cultivation methods cannot support 9.5 billion people. The solution is obvious: On the one hand, genetic engineering is used to transform existing crops, and on the other hand, through the Internet of Things technology, plant data is collected and appropriate cultivation is carried out.</p>
<p>If you want to connect the plants in the farmland of China and conduct a simple analysis, the size of this database will reach 7.7EB. The data of 7.7EB is only the cultivated land in China. If you want to improve the farmland around the world, the amount of data will be even larger.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning. If the future of human beings is to break away from its carbon-based life and become a silicon-based life, the first problem to be solved is the storage of human-level information of up to 100 billion neurons, which requires a ZB-level database.</p>
<p>And the bigger story begins with a small fish tank: a fish tank can exist independently of the river, because we simulate all the ecology in the river: temperature, salinity, water flow, nitrate concentration, oxygen content Wait.</p>
<p>Then we have to think about how powerful data processing and analysis capabilities are needed if humans are to explore and transform an extraterrestrial galaxies into Earth.</p>
<p>Atmospheric flow, ocean currents, crustal movement, and illumination, each of which is a huge amount of NB-level data.</p>
<p>At the end of the last century, humans built the Biosphere No. 2, which simulates extraterrestrial survival, but it ended in failure. The lack of accurate data and analytical ability is a crucial factor.</p>
<p>In today’s view, to solve these technological highlands, quantum databases are one of the technical paths that can be seen. By completely innovating the computer architecture and replacing the conventional calculations with quantum computing, it is possible to realize DB-level mass storage, and Massive analysis with 1 million times the capacity of today’s highest performance database.</p>
<p>On the eve of the coming of the new year in 2018, the Alibaba Cloud Database made a prediction that the quantum database is one of the key civilized leaps in the next 100 years.</p>
<p>Maybe the future is not coming, but believe that the future must be on the road.</p>
<p>Therefore, to be or not to be, is a matter of database.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-1"><a href="#Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1"></a>Chapter 1</h3><p>May was also her name. </p>
<p>However cliché this seems, I am not trying to make it a pun. After all, we never even talked in May. We met in our freshman year in a group project and that was it. No sparks. Not even Oxygen. So imagine how I felt when, one day in the summer vacation before my senior year, she just commented one of the articles I shared on social media out of the blue. It’s like a book on the shelf just randomly drops on your feet, and then you pick it up with the faintest idea of how you got it in the first place.</p>
<p>All the memory left after 3 years was she looked pretty(maybe) and quiet as the morning breeze in May. Like the name suggests. So I, a little bit flattered, tried to be cool and replied with some sweet remarks from the article. </p>
<p>Then she replied back.</p>
<p>The next thing I knew was, we began chatting in the comment zone at midnight, with a kind of unknown chemistry. The following days would witness us chatting over the phone every night before going to bed. And one day she would be laying in my arms, with tears in her eyes. She asked me one day how I felt when I started “hitting on her”, I told her this little tale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, you were doing nothing as always, living your day to day mundane life. Nothing worth mentioning happens in your life. Then all of a sudden you saw a rope. At first sight it looked like a snake and you were afraid of snakes. So you stood aghast, speechless. When you find it was only a rope, you began to wonder the other end of it. What could it be? You pulled, and 3 Mississippi’s later, something pulled on the other end. It could be a naughty dog, but deep down inside your heart, you wished it was a signal, a language or most important of it all, a cure to the meaningless life you were living. So you pulled again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s how I felt. I wasn’t sure if May understood it. I wasn’t sure if I understood it. I wasn’t telling a parable; I was just describing a state of mind. It was a very personal thing anyway. I think she bought it at that time because she stopped asking any more questions. Or maybe it was only because it was at midnight.</p>
<p>So back to the first midnight we began chatting. I had some drinks that night. I was doing an internship at a tech company. The work load was fine but I wasn’t enjoying it as I thought it would make me. It was my dream company and when I actually got in and get my dream job, I began wondering if all this dreams are misguided illusions. Maybe I made myself love the job just because my subconscious thought it would maximize my chances of survival and getting laid. So I was constantly in the state of being both awake and lost. Being aware of lost is worse than lost completely, which explains the drinks I had.</p>
<p>It could be the alcohol, for I felt joy when I was chatting with her. My creativity was flowing and I replied clever and flirty remarks like Romeo of every girl’s dreams. Or at least that’s what I felt at the moment. I sensed something different about this girl, May. She was able to keep up with the flow. We talked like two people walking out of a compilation of clever remarks by Plátōn, Bernard Shaw and Woody Allen. The chemistry was amazing and there were not just sparks but an explosion of flirting, sarcastic and witty messages.</p>
<p>I decided to make the first move. Pounding was my heart, and gentle was my touch on her chat box like treading on thin ice. I sent the message that literally changed our lives, with an adorable meme,<br>“How you doing”</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h2 id="01"><a href="#01" class="headerlink" title="01"></a>01</h2><p>My friend of benefit (<em>intellectually of course</em>, :) Kaitlyn de Maine recommended <a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is water</a> speech by David Foster Wallace to me，claiming that I would love it. And SURE I DO. ^0^ So I thought it would be sweet if I write something about it. Since my personal blog just set up, this would make a strong start.</p>
<h2 id="02"><a href="#02" class="headerlink" title="02"></a>02</h2><p>At the beginning of the speech, there is a parable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”                                </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So, what is water?</strong></p>
<p>Take a moment to think about what is special about water: It is transparent, it is everywhere and it had been here long before any of the fishes were born, which makes the fishes totally <em>unaware</em> of it. Now you see, the parable, as well as the speech, is about <strong>awareness</strong>.</p>
<p>Mainly, awareness about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness about yourself and your certainties</li>
<li>Awareness about what to worship</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-1-Awareness-about-yourself-and-your-certainties"><a href="#2-1-Awareness-about-yourself-and-your-certainties" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Awareness about yourself and your certainties"></a>2.1 Awareness about yourself and your certainties</h3><p>Just like what he said in the speech：The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Too often we ignore the most plain and common things around us. We get used to lots of things, taking them for granted and accept claims without a second thought. There are so many things that we are just automatically sure of, as if they were hard-wired into our boards at birth. David ( who addressed the speech) gave one example of the total wrongness of something he tends to be automatically sure of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds arrogant, conceited and pretencious but very ture and sincere. I guess deep down inside our heart, more or less we’ve all been through this stage. At least I did and I doubt if I have ever been ‘through’ it. This reminds me of my WeChat alias(user name). </p>
<p>*FYI WeChat is an app We Chinese use, in some ways it’s like Snapchat + Instagram + Facebook + Paypal.</p>
<p>The alias consists of a Chinese charater of my last name and these letters–”NPC”. <strong>NPC</strong>, meaning Non-Player Charater, is an idea from video games, mainly Role-Playing games. I, too, used to think that I am the absolute centre of the universe. I have always been the sentimental type and one day I just wake up with the idea that I am no centre of the universe and then I just went from one extreme to another: That life is a game and I am only a NPC, having no control over my own life, and the highlight of my entire life is being a background for the big names like Jack Ma, Steve Jobs, Kim Chŏng-ŭn… you name it. Luckily that kind of feeling didn’t last very long and I kept the name ever since because I also find it important to constantly remind myself that <strong>I am no centre of the universe</strong> and sometimes might as well view myself as a NPC and then, all the winning and losing, sorrows and pains doesn’t matter that much.</p>
<p>And here I would quote Sir Romain Rolland:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Il n’ya qu’un héroïsme au monde : c’est de voir le monde tel qu’il est et de l’aimer.</em><br>There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is and to love it.<br>    by Romain Rolland</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-2-Awareness-about-what-to-worship"><a href="#2-2-Awareness-about-what-to-worship" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Awareness about what to worship"></a>2.2 Awareness about what to worship</h3><p>David said in the speech:</p>
<ul>
<li>“If you worship money and things, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough.  </li>
<li>Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. </li>
<li>Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. </li>
<li>Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.<br>But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Everybody seems worship one of the above. The horrible thing is most of the time it is our defalut setting, it is blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up. SO you have to be aware of what you worship before your pursuit consumes you. Never be the a slave to your head and your natural default settings.</p>
<h2 id="03-Coda–the-real-freedom"><a href="#03-Coda–the-real-freedom" class="headerlink" title="03 Coda–the real freedom"></a>03 Coda–the real freedom</h2><p>At the end of the day, after fighting against our arrogant selves, our blind certainties and our pride and prejudice we got to know the <strong>real freedom</strong>.</p>
<p>“The kind of freedom that involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.”</p>
<p>The day you begin to see the water as it is, is when you are truly free and alive.</p>
